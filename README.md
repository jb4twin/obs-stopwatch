# ‚è±Ô∏è A Stop Watch for OBS

Simply counts up from zero once you enable the browser source. That's it.

Add a browser source then add the following URL: `https://jb4twin.github.io/obs-stopwatch?offset=0`

JB Addition: set a `offset` value in ms to start the timer at a desired time. Useful when you had to stop the timer for whatever reason but want to start again at the time you stopped.

**Note:** If you do not want the stopwatch to reset on scene switch then you need to create a new scene with just the stopwatch and overlay it on your other scenes. Hope it makes sense.
